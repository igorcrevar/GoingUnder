Little imp is going home somewhere down under. His quest is pretty hard, I mean, like flappy bird hard.
Every 30 obstacles his quest is getting harder. First five obstacles should be easy to pass, though.
This is not your average flappy bird clone, its original, but influence is obvious :)
Cute graphics and NES like sound / music. Current high score is 343 (MAN!). Flappy bird, watch out, new guy is in town (well, in water in this case)!
Leader-boards and achievements!
Controls work in opposite direction:
- Tap on the left part of the screen to push imp to the right
- Tap on the right part of the screen to push imp to the left
It's easier to play with both thumbs!
